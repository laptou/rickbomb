# rickbomb

This is a prank program. You need to place a video of your choosing (preferably [Never Gonna Give You Up by Rick Astley](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)) in a file named `rick.mkv` inside of the `rickbomb/` folder. Then press compile.

## what it does

This program silently waits for the user to press the R key. Once they do, then it plays `rick.mkv` from start to finish. The user cannot exit the video except by killing the process, which is not easy b/c the video appears above all other windows.

## system requirements

This program requires Windows 10 in order to run.
